  # Hi👋, I'm Amrit Kaur

## 🚀 About Me
Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast | Python | AI | Problem Solver

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages:** Python
- **ML / AI:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Others:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Tableau


## Projects 
1. [**Ask Me Anything About Yoga - RAG Application**]
- Built a **domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) application** to answer user queries strictly from curated yoga content.
- Implemented an **end-to-end document ingestion and embedding piepline** using sentence-transformer models.
- Stored embeddings in **FAISS/ChromaDB** to enable semantic similarity search and relevant context retrieval.
- Integrated **LLM-based answer generation with retrieval grounding,** significantly reducing hallucinations.
- **Deployed the backend API on Render and the frontend on Vercel,** enabling a fully functional, production-ready micro-RAG application.
  **Tools:** Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, Sentence-Transformers, FAISS, ChromaDB, Render, Vercel, LLMs.

2. [**AI Document Chatbot – Document Question Answering System**]
- Developed an AI-powered web application that answers user questions based on uploaded documents.
- Built backend services using FastAPI to ingest documents, chunk text, generate embeddings, and store vectors.
- Implemented semantic retrieval using ChromaDB to fetch the most relevant document sections per query.
- Ensured response grounding by restricting LLM outputs strictly to retrieved document context.
- Designed a lightweight frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless real-time interaction.
- **Tools:** Python, FastAPI, ChromaDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- 
3. [**Domain-Specific Sentiment Analysis with Low-Resource NLP**]
- Created a 4-class labeled dataset from Reddit Break-Up Stories for a low-resource NLP setting.
- Compared **transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT)** with classical approaches **(TF-IDF + SVM, Logistic Regression)**.
- Applied data augmentation techniques including **back-translation and synonym replacement**.
- Built cross-validation pipelines and evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Added model interpretability through key-phrase highlighting and deployed an interactive demo.
- **Tools:** HuggingFace Transformers, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Gradio.
